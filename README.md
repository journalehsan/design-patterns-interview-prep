A comprehensive collection of design patterns implemented in Python with interview-focused examples, real-world scenarios, and detailed explanations. Perfect for technical interview preparation!

## 🎯 What's This About?

This repository contains **12 essential design patterns** that are commonly asked in technical interviews, each with:
